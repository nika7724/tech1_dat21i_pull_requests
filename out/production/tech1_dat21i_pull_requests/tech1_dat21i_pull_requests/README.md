Here are some of the things that Markdown can do:

## Headings can be added by typing "#" in front of text
### The amount of "#" indicates the heading number; this would be heading 3

You can also use *italics* and **bolded** text wherever you wish.

Blockquotes are a thing too! (You can embed blockqoute inside a blockquote too, go wild)
>> *"There's a very simple solution for that: You just need to install 57 plugins for Neovim."*
>>
>> — Bartosz
>
> — Octavian
> 
>> "It's true"
>
> — Bartosz

And you can write in-line code like this: `console.log("Very important code");` In-line means it's located inside regular text.

Markdown has URL support; here is [a link to my Markdown Previewer](https://roman-octavian.github.io/FCC-Markdown-Previewer/).

There are unordered and ordered lists too:
* Unordered list element
* Unordered list element
1. Ordered list element
1. Ordered list element, I'm only using 1s

Here's a code block, for a change:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
And, lastly, aside from cat gifs, images can also be embedded with Markdown:
